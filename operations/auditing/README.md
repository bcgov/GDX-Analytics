```
$ cd audting
$ pipenv install
```
Optionally, set following environment variables if you don't want to supply the information in every invocation.

* PGHOST - Redshift host
* PGUSER - Redshift user name
* PGPASSWORD - Redshift user password
* lookerUrlPrefix - Looker url prefix such as https://looker.local:19999/api/3.1

```
$ pipenv run python createAuditReport.py -h
usage: createAuditReport.py [-h] [-s LOOKERCLIENTSECRET] [-H PGHOST]
                            [-u PGUSER] [-p PGPASSWORD] [-l LOOKERURLPREFIX]
                            siteHost lookerClientId

Generate report for site *foo.com* into file *report.csv* if PGHOST, PGUSER, PGPASSWORD and lookerUrlPrefix have been supplied via environment variables.
```
$ pipenv run python createAuditReport.py -H redshift.host -u reshift_user -p reshift_user_password -l https://looker.local:19999/api/3.1 -s myLookerClientSecret foo.com myLookerClientId  > report.csv
