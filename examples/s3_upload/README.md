## S3 Upload Utility 

This bash script lets you upload files to s3 without installing any additional tools beyond standard Unix utilities. It is based on [vszakats/s3-upload-aws4.sh](https://gist.github.com/vszakats/2917d28a951844ab80b1)

## Project Status

Currently this project is still in development.

## To Run

You must set two environment variables
```
$ export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="<<AWS_KEY>>"
$ export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="<<AWS_SECRET_KEY>>
```

And run

```
$ sh s3-upload-aws4.sh <<localfile>> <<bucket>> <<region>> <<remotepath>> <<OPTIONAL:storageclass>>
```

For example:

```
$ sh s3-upload-aws4.sh  local/path/foo.csv  bucket-name ca-central-1 remote/path 
```

will upload the file "foo.csv" in the local directory "local/path" and place it in s3 in "ca-central-1" at "bucket-name/bucket-name/remote/path/foo.csv"
