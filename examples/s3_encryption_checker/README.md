## S3 Encryption Checker

The [s3_encryption_checker.py](s3_encryption_checker.py) python script searches through an S3 bucket to detect any objects that are not encrypted. It is a good, relatively simple, example of how to programmatically access S3 using [Boto](http://boto.cloudhackers.com/en/latest/)
