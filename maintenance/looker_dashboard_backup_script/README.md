# Looker Dashboard Backup Script

These scripts are designed to perform a backup of Looker dashboards from all spaces under shared frolder in our Looker instances and push the data to a Git repository. They are currently scheduled to run as a nightly cron job in both dev and prod instances.

## Prerequisites

Before using this script, make sure you have the following:

1. Access to looker_dev and looker_prod instances via terminal
2. Environment Variable GZR_PATH set in your bashrc file like this 
    `export GZR_PATH="/home/looker/bin/gzr"`
3. The `gzr` command-line tool installed, which is used to interact with Looker via the Looker API.
4. Properly configured `.netrc` file containing your Looker credentials.

All of the above prerequisites are already satisfied in looker_dev instance
