## GDX Analytics Elastisearch Query Example

### [elasticsearch_tail.py](./elasticsearch_tail.py)
Simulates a unix like tail command for Elasticsearch

Configuration file should contain line separated list of fields to query from the Elasticsearch index and application specified.

It's recommended to set environment variables for the ES endpoint, credentials, and index for regular use:

```
export ES_USER='<<ElasticSearch_Username>>'
export ES_PASS='<<ElasticSearch_Password>>'
export ES_ENDPOINT='<<ElasticSearch_Endpoint>>'
export ES_INDEX='<<ElasticSearch_Index>>'
```

Optionally, you can run this in a Python 2.7 virtual environment, to avoid any possibility of package conflicts with your user level python library installations:

```
virtualenv -p python2 venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Usage example including optional `--debug`:
```
python elasticsearch_tail.py --endpoint $ES_ENDPOINT --index $ES_INDEX --username $ES_USER --password $ES_PASS --application <app_id> --config <config_file> --debug
```

A sample result will appear as (the following is not real data):
```

```
### [elasticsearch_pageviews.py](./elasticsearch_pageviews.py)
Counts pageviews from 1 hour previous to the current time for Elasticsearch
and snowplow.

A Configuration file should contain line separated list of domains to query from Elasticsearch index and endpoint specified.

Example Usage:
```
python3 elasticsearch_pageviews.py --config <config_file> --username $ES_USER --password $ES_PASS --endpoint $ES_ENDPOINT --index $ES_INDEX
```
A sample result will appear as (the following is not real data):
```
2019-07-15 14:54:40,181:[INFO]: intranet.gov.bc.ca page views successfully queried
Domain:  intranet.gov.bc.ca  Page Views:  4260
2019-07-15 14:54:40,362:[INFO]: www.env.gov.bc.ca page views successfully queried
Domain:  www.env.gov.bc.ca  Page Views:  4154
```
### [elasticsearch_linesize.py](./elasticsearch_linesize.py)
Queries elasticsearch for the current day and calculates the number of people in line for given Service BC offices.

A configuration file must be created and should contain line separated list of Service BC office locations (eg: Kelowna, Kamloops) to query from Elasticsearch index and endpoint specified.

A json file, serviceBCOfficeList.json, containing Service BC office names and IDs must be created and included in the same directory as the script.

Example Usage:
````
python3 elasticsearch_linesize.py --config <config_file> --username $ES_USER --password $ES_PASS --endpoint $ES_ENDPOINT --index $ES_INDEX
````

A sample result will appear as

```
2019-08-08 13:54:58,053:[INFO]: Number of people in line in the Kelowna Service BC office successfully queried
Office:  Kelowna  Current number of people in line:  2
