## S3 to Redshift Microservice

These micrsoservice scripts automate the migration of well formed `csv` data on S3 into Redshift. The `json` configuration files specify the expected form of data.

## Project Status

Currently this project is still in development.

The `cmslitemetadata_to_redshift` diverged from `s3_to_redshift` to process data containing nested delimeters, requiring dictonary and lookup tables; but due to inherent overlap, these scripts are good candidates for consolidation.
