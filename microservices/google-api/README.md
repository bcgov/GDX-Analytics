### Google Search API Loader Microservice

The `google_search.py` script automates the loading of Google Search API data into S3 (as `.csv`) and Redshift (the `google.googlesearch` schema as defined by `google.googlesearch.sql`).

The accompanying `google_search.json` configuration file specifies the bucket, schema, the sites to query the Google Search API for, and optional start dates on those sites.

The microservice will begin loading Google data from the date specified in the configuration as `"start_date_default"`. If that is unspecified, it will attempt to load data from 16 months ago relative to the script runtime. If more recent data already exists; it will load data from the day after the last date that has already been loaded into Redshift.

It currently runs in batches of a maximum of 30 days at a time until 2 days ago (the latest available data from the Google Search API).

#### Configuration

The JSON configuration is loaded as an environmental variable defined as `GOOGLE_MICROSERVICE_CONFIG`. It follows this structure:

- `"bucket"`: a string to define the S3 bucket where CSV Google Search API query responses are stored.
- `"dbtable`: a string to define the Redshift table where the S3 stored CSV files are inserted to to after their creation.
- `"sites"`: a JSON array containing objects defining a `"name"` and an optional `"start_date_default"`.
  - `"name"`: the site URL to query the Google Search API on.
  - `"start_date_default"`: an _optional_ key identifying where to begin queries from as a YYYY-MM-DD string. If excluded, the default behaviour is to look back to the earliest date that the Google Search API exposes, which is 16 months (scripted as 480 days).

```
{
    "bucket": string,
    "dbtable": "google.googlesearch",
    "sites":[
        {
        "name":"https://www2.gov.bc.ca/"
        }
    ]
}
```

### Google My Business Driving Directions Loader Microservice

#### Script
The `google_directions.py` script automates the loading of Google MyBusiness Driving Directions insights reports into S3 (as a `.csv` file), which it then loads to Redshift. When run, logs are appended to `logs/google_directions.log`. Create the logs directory before running if it does not already exist. The script requires a `JSON` config file as specifid in the "_Configuration_" section below. It also must be passed command line locations for Google Credentials files; a usage example is in the header comment in the script itself.

#### Table
The `google.gmb_directions` schema is defined by the [`google.gmb_directions.sql`](./`google.gmb_directions.sql) ddl  file.

#### Configuration
The configuration for this microservice is in the `google_directions.json` file.

The JSON configuration fields are as described below:

| Key label | Value type | Value Description |
|-|-|-|
| `bucket` | string | The bucket name to write to |
| `dbtable` | string | The table name in Redshift to insert on |
| `destination` | string | A top level path in the S3 bucket to deposit the files after processing (good or bad), and also to check for to determine if this microservice was already run today (in order to avoid inserting duplicate data) |
| `locationGroups[]` | object (`location`) | objects representing locations, described below. This is an object to in order to accommodate future expansion on this field as necessary. |

`location` has been structured as an object in order to allow easier future extensibility, if necessary. The fields currently set in `location` are described below:

| Key label | Value type | Value Description |
|-|-|-|
| `clientShortname` | string | An internal shortname for a client's location group. An environment variable must be set as: `<clientShortname>_accountid=<accountid>` in order to map the Location Group Account ID to this client shortname and pull the API data. The `clientShortname` is also used to set the object path on S3 as: `S3://<bucket>/client/google_mybusiness_<clientShortname>` |
| `aggregate_days[]` | string | A 1 to 3 item list that can include only unique values of `"SEVEN"`, `"THIRTY"` or `"NINETY"` |

## Project Status

As clients provide GDX Analytics with access to their Google Search of My Business profiles, they will be added to the configuration file to be handled by the microservice.
