# Secure File Transfer System microservice

This folder contains scripts, configuration files (within the [config.d](./config.d/) folder), and SQL formatted DML files (within the [dml](./dml/) folder) that enable the the Secure File Transfer System (SFTS) microservice implemented on the GDX-Analytics platform.


## Overview

### `redshift_to_s3.py`

The Redshift to S3 microservice requires:

 - a `json` configuration file passed as a second command line argument to run.

 - a `dml` SQL formatted query file to perform inside a nesting `UNLOAD` command.

- The following environment variables must be set:

  - `$pguser`

    the user with query access to the Redshift database.

  - `$pgpass`

    the password for the `$pguser`.

The configuration file format is described in more detail below. Usage is like:

```
python redshift_to_s3.py -c config.d/config.json
```

### `s3_to_sfts.py`

The S3 to SFTS microservice requires:

 - A Java runtime environment that can be invoked with the command line `java`

 - a `json` configuration file passed as a second command line argument to run.

 - The following environment variables must be set:

  - `$xfer_path`

    the path to the folder containing the MOVEit XFer Client Tools. The XFer Client Tools can be downloaded from the link labelled "Client Tools Zip (EZ, Freely, Xfer)" at  https://community.ipswitch.com/s/article/Direct-Download-Links-for-Transfer-and-Automation-2018).

    For example:
    ```
    export xfer_path=/path/to/xfer/jar/files/
    ```
    the folder _must_ contain `jna.jar` and `xfer.jar`

  - `$sfts_user`

    the service account user configured for access to the Secure File Transfer system, and with write access to SFTS path defined by the value for `sfts_path` in the json configuration file.

    ```
    export sfts_user=username  ## do not include an IDIR/ prefix in the username
    ```

  - `$sfts_pass`

    the password associated with the `$sfts_user` service account.

The configuration file format is described in more detail below. Usage is like:

```
python s3_to_sfts.py -c config.d/config.json
```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

The S3 to Redshift microservice requires the following environment variables be set to run correctly.

- `sfts_user`: the SFTS username used with `sfts_pass` to access the SFTS database;
- `sfts_pass`: the SFTS password used with `sfts_user` to access the SFTS database;
- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`: the AWS access key for the account authorized to perform COPY commands from S3 to Redshift; and,
- `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`: the AWS secret access key for the account authorized to perform COPY commands from S3 to Redshift.

### Configuration File

Store these in [config.d/](./config.d/).

Overlap of the variables used in both `redshift_to_s3.py` and `s3_to_sfts.py` means a single configuration file can support both scripts. Furthermore, a single configuration file is recommended to reduce introducing the possibility for errors.

The JSON configuration is required as a second argument when running the `s3_to_redshift.py` script.

The structure of the config file should resemble the following:

```
{
  "bucket": String,
  "source": String,
  "directory": String,
  "destination": String,
  "object_prefix": String,
  "dml": String,
  "header": Boolean,
  "sfts_path": String,
  "extension": String
}
```

The keys in the config file are defined as:

- `"bucket"`: the label defining the S3 bucket that the microservice will reference.
- `"source"`: the first prefix of source objects, as in: `s3://<bucket>/<source>/.../<object>`.
- `"directory"`: the last path prefix before the object itself: `s3://<bucket>/<source>/<directory>/<object>` or `s3://<bucket>/<destination>/<good|bad|batch>/<source>/<directory>/<object>`
- `"destination"`: the first prefix of processed objects, as in `s3://<bucket>/<destination>/<good|bad|batch>`.
- `"object_prefix"`: The final prefix of the object; treat this as a prefix on the filename itself.
- `"dml"`: The filename under the `./dml`(./dml/) directory in this repository that contains the SQL statement to run as an UNLOAD command.
- `"header"`: Setting this to true will write a first row of column header values; setting as false will omit that row.
- `"sfts_path"`: The folder path in SFTS where the objects retrieved from S3 will be uploaded to.
- `"extension"`: A postfix to the file name. As an extension, it must include the '`.`' character before the extension type, such as: '`.csv`'.

### DML File

Store these in [dml/](./dml/).

This is simply a Redshift `UNLOAD` compatible query. The Redshift documentation for `UNLOAD` specifies how the `'select-statement'` must appear.

Note that there are some particular issues that are likely to cause problems:
- you may not use single quotes; since `UNLOAD` itself wraps the select-statement with single quotes. If you require single quotes in your statement, use a pair of single quotes instead
- The `SELECT` query can't use a `LIMIT` clause in the outer `SELECT`. Instead, use a nested `LIMIT` clause.

For more information see the Amazon Redshift documentation for UNLOAD: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/r_UNLOAD.html

## Project Status

As new projects require loading modeled data into SFTS, new configuration files will be prepared to support the consumption of those data sources.

This project is ongoing.
