# CloudWatch Event Parser

This project contains source code and supporting files for a serverless
application to fomat incoming json object and publish to a SNS topic.

## Overview

AWS Config sends detailed information about the configuration changes and
notifications to Amazon CloudWatch Events. Rules can be defined in CloudWatch
to filter the events and send to downstreams such as SNS. However, the
filtered events is not properly formatted, making it less readable when received
by SNS subscribers. This application adds the json formatting
function to the event processing pipeline. To further improve readability, for a selected few known event types, the app also sets a customized more specific subject and adds a summary paragragh at the beginning of the message body before the event.

## Components

The project is built using [AWS SAM](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/what-is-sam.html).
It includes following files and folders

- AWSConfigMessageComposer - Code for the application's Lambda function.
- events - Invocation events that you can use to invoke the function.
- template.yaml - A template that defines the application's AWS resources.
- samconfig.toml - sam deploy defaults

## Deploy the application

### Prerequisites

- [Python 3.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [SAM CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-sam-cli-install.html)
- A valid AWS CLI profile. For account that requires MFA, the profile must contain a non-expired session token.

### Build and Deploy

To build and deploy your application for the first time, run the following in your shell:

```
sam build
sam deploy --guided --profile <your-aws-cli-profile>
```

The first command will build the source of your application. The second command will package and deploy your application to AWS, with a series of prompts:

- **Stack Name**: The name of the stack to deploy to CloudFormation. This should be unique to your account and region, and a good starting point would be something matching your project name.
- **AWS Region**: The AWS region you want to deploy your app to.
- **Parameter targetSNSArnParameter**: The SNS topic Arn to publish parsed event to. If leaving to default _changeMe_, the function essentially will do nothing.
- **Confirm changes before deploy**: If set to yes, any change sets will be shown to you before execution for manual review. If set to no, the AWS SAM CLI will automatically deploy application changes.
- **Allow SAM CLI IAM role creation**: Many AWS SAM templates, including this example, create AWS IAM roles required for the AWS Lambda function(s) included to access AWS services. By default, these are scoped down to minimum required permissions. To deploy an AWS CloudFormation stack which creates or modified IAM roles, the `CAPABILITY_IAM` value for `capabilities` must be provided. If permission isn't provided through this prompt, to deploy this example you must explicitly pass `--capabilities CAPABILITY_IAM` to the `sam deploy` command.
- **Save arguments to samconfig.toml**: If set to yes, your choices will be saved to a configuration file inside the project, so that in the future you can just re-run `sam deploy` without parameters to deploy changes to your application.

## Usage

## Usage
This Lambda function is designed to be used in a CloudWatch event rule. Just 
set the rule target to this Lambda function.

## Use SAM CLI to build and test locally

1. Build your application

   ```bash
   sam build
   ```

2. Create file */.env.json*

   ```
   {
      "JsonFormatterFunction": {
         "TARGET_SNS_ARN": "<target_sns_arn>"
      }
   }
   ```
   Replace *\<target_sns_arn\>* with your target SNS ARN

3. Invoke *JsonFormatterFunction* locally

   ```
   sam local invoke --event events/configItemUpdate.json --env-vars .env.json --profile <your-aws-cli-profile> JsonFormatterFunction
   ```

### Step-through debugging with VS Code

#### Prerequisites

All prerequisites listed in _Deploy the application_ section above plus

To enable step-through debugging, 
 1. Open [app.code-workspace](./app.code-workspace) in VS Code
 2.  uncomment following 4 lines in [AWSConfigMessageComposer/app.py](./AWSConfigMessageComposer/app.py#L7)

    ```
    # import ptvsd
    # print('Attach debugger to proceed...')
    # ptvsd.enable_attach(address=('0.0.0.0', 5890), redirect_output=True)
    # ptvsd.wait_for_attach()
    ```

3.  Set a breakpoint in AWSConfigMessageComposer/app.py below the above uncommented lines
4.  Run

    ```
    sam build
    sam local invoke -e events/event.json -d 5890 --env-vars .env.json JsonFormatterFunction
    ```
    The last cmd will hung at the output `Attach debugger to proceed...` waiting for a debugger to be attached.
 5. Hit `F5` to start debugging using the *SAM CLI Python* launch config.

## Cleanup

```
aws cloudformation delete-stack --stack-name GovBC-GDX-cloudwatch-event-parser --profile <your-aws-cli-profile>
```
