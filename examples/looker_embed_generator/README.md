## GDX Analytics Looker Embed Generator

These Java and Python examples demonstrate the generation of cryptographically signed SSO embed URL pointing to a dashboard or view exposed through the Looker embed user. The Looker Embed Secret key is required to generate these with the appropriate signature and nonce.

This includes two examples:
* [looker_embed_generator.java](looker_embed_generator.java) implements the example in Java
* [looker_embed_generator.py](looker_embed_generator.py) implements the example in Python27

## Project Status

Currently this project is still in development.

## To Run

These are command line applications. `LOOKERKEY` must be set for this session.

Parameters:
- `env`: the target Looker environment, e.g.: `prod` or `test`
- `embed_url`: the target look or dashboard, e.g.: `looks/98`
- `attribute`: a User-Attribute to pass, e.g.: `browser`
- `filter`: a filter on the passed User-Attribute, e.g.: `Chrome`

The Java version accepts all optional attribute and filter parameters as follows:

```
java looker_embed_generator <<environment>> <<embed_url>> [<<attribute>> <<filter>>]
```

The Python version will accept the `embed_url` as a required argument:

```
python looker_embed_generator.py <<embed url>>
```

It can also be passed a dashboard filter-name and filter-value:

```
python looker_embed_generator.py <<embed url>> <<filter-name>> <<filter-value>>
```
