## GDX Analytics Python Example

### [sn.py](./sn.py)
This code is a proof of concept of Python code required to add Snowplow instrumentation using the initial CFMS proof of concept model. For more information on the Snowplow Python Tracker see https://github.com/snowplow/snowplow-python-tracker.

### [call_analytics_openshift_gateway.py](./call_analytics_openshift_gateway.py)
Sample Python script showing the structure of an example event, and the requirements to call the GDX Analytics OpenShift Snowplow Gateway service with that event data. See https://github.com/bcgov/GDX-Analytics-OpenShift-Snowplow-Gateway-Service

- [call_analytics_openshift_gateway.py](./call_analytics_openshift_gateway.py) based on dummy variables this creates an object as JSON and POSTs it to the hostname passed as an argument. This is used to simply test the GDX Analytics OpenShift Snowplow Gateway service. An example of the *kind* of JSON event that service can accept is also provided here as [post_data.json](./post_data.json). This file may be helpful for tests of the service using tools like [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) or [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/), or simply using cURL as:
```
curl -vX POST <<hostname>> -d @post_data.json --header "Content-Type: application/json"
```
You may require the `--insecure` flag on the above command if you need to skip certificate validation.

## Project Status

Currently this project is still in development.

## Requirements

If running [sn.py](./sn.py), you will first need to install the [snowplow-tracker](https://pypi.org/project/snowplow-tracker/) package:
```
$ sudo pip install snowplow-tracker
```

*Note:* this package is not required to use analytics when calling the [GDX-Analytics OpenShift Snowplow Gateway Service](https://github.com/bcgov/GDX-Analytics-OpenShift-Snowplow-Gateway-Service) tracker such as through [call_analytics_openshift_gateway.py](./call_analytics_openshift_gateway.py). The only dependencies are: [http.client](https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.client.html), [time](https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html), and [json](https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html) from the Python Standard Library.

## To Run

To run  [sn.py](./sn.py):
```
$ python sn.py
```

To run [call_analytics_openshift_gateway.py](./call_analytics_openshift_gateway.py):
```
$ python call_analytics_openshift_gateway.py [<<hostname>>] [<<hostport>>] [<<snowplow_endpoint>>] [--insecure | -i] [--debug | -d]
```
- Passing no additional command line arguments when running `call_analytics_openshift_gateway.py` will result in the default hostname of `localhost`, the default port of `8443`, and the default endpoint as `test`.
- the `<<snowplow_endpoint>>` options are `test` or `prod`. This is the string that populates the value for the `'env'` key in the POST body request JSON payload.
- The optional flag `--insecure` will transmit the POST request insecurely over `http`. Otherwise, the message will be packaged as an `https` request.
- The optional flag `--debug` is sets the logs to be at the `debug` level instead of the default `info` level.
- Likely values for the `[<<hostname>>]` argument are `caps.pathfinder.gov.bc.ca` (the production OpenShift route) or `localhost` or `0.0.0.0` (if testing locally).
- Likely values for the `[<<hostport>>]` optional argument are `8443` (if testing locally) or `443` if calling the service running on OpenShift.
- Note that the GDX Analytics OpenShift Snowplow Gateway Service is currently whitelisted to allow only BC Government IP ranges (including the IP ranges for OpenShift itself).

## Special files in this repository
The files in [examples/schemas/ca.bc.gov.cfmspoc](../schemas/ca.bc.gov.cfmspoc) are the Snowplow schema files. See https://github.com/snowplow/iglu for more info.

## If you encounter an SSL certificate error
When connecting to Snowplow signed by a BC Government SSL certificate you may encounter this Python error:
```
WARNING:snowplow_tracker.emitters:[SSL: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED] certificate verify failed (_ssl.c:833)
```
This occurs on some systems where your Python environment is missing the root certificate used to sign our SSL certificate. It appears that the Certificate Authority (CA) for Entrust is missing.

You can test this on the main HTTPS certificate using an interactive Python session by running:
```
>>> import requests
>>> requests.get('https://www2.gov.bc.ca')
```

To work around this issue, download the CA from https://www.entrustdatacard.com/pages/root-certificates-download.
Look for the "Entrust Root Certificate Authority—G2" and download the certificate from https://entrust.com/root-certificates/entrust_g2_ca.cer.

To ensure that Python loads this CA, can set this environment variable:
```
# export REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE=/path/to/entrust_g2_ca.cer
```
